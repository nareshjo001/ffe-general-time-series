"""
POLICY (all three are independent; a job matching ANY is deleted)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
  - FAILED, completed > cleanup_failed_after_hours ago
  - DONE, completed > cleanup_done_after_days ago
  - CREATED/UPLOADING, no status update for > cleanup_abandoned_after_hours

Phase F.4: QUEUED/RUNNING are deliberately NOT part of the "abandoned"
branch above (see job_store.find_cleanup_candidates's docstring) - a
QUEUED job may legitimately be waiting behind another job for the Phase 2
execution lock, and a RUNNING job may legitimately take a long time with
no heartbeat. Genuinely stale QUEUED/RUNNING rows (left over from a
previous process instance) are instead repaired by
`job_store.reconcile_interrupted_jobs()` once, at startup, which marks
them FAILED - after which they become ordinary cleanup candidates under
the FAILED branch above, same as any other failure.

Deletion removes BOTH the job's directory tree AND its metadata row in
the same pass - the metadata row does not outlive the files it describes,
so job_store never accumulates permanent history of every job ever run.
