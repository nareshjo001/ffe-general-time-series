class ParallelEvaluationController:
    """
    Production evaluation path.

    Uses three workers, one for each independent evaluation phase:
    packet, flow stateless, and flow stateful.

    Each worker:
      1. Opens a read-only connection to the job's database.
      2. Evaluates its assigned phase.
      3. Runs the phase's independent queries in parallel via BaseRunner.run_all(max_workers=...).

    Evaluation is read-only once ingestion has finished, so multiple
    read-only DuckDB connections can safely access the same database
    concurrently.

    This combines phase-level parallelism (3 workers) with query-level
    parallelism (up to QUERY_WORKERS per phase) to significantly reduce
    overall evaluation time.
